I have created a customized OS image using a centos image as the base os
This image can be installed in any OS using the docker containerization technique.
Link for downloading my image: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/anupreetdube/mycentos

This image is publicly available for download at hub.docker.com

The Extra Features of this image are:
1. preconfigured Yum
2. net-tools software 
3. httpd software
4. firefox browser
5. java script

The above mentioned 4 features are not available in any raw centos image available on docker hub

The benefits of the above installed softwares are:

1. Yum helps to download the softwares
In my image the yum is already configured to install any softwares related to docker or linux.
2. Net-tools software helps find the IP address of our Container via the "ifconfig" command
3. The httpd software helps to configure the Web Server
4. Firefox browser helps browse the content on internet
5. The openjdk software helps installation any working of any software that works on java script
The best example is : Jenkins
